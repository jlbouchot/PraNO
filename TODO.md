Things that need to be done relatively soon. 
This is a non-ordered list, which reflects, without the priorities, the kanban associated to this repository

* Add linear solver in the LMA algorithms (remember that the solver should be associated with its own parameters)
* Add a parameter parser in all classes (in particular for the linear solvers, cf the point above)
* Implement dogleg
* Add theory to the Fixed point notebook and proof of Banach fixed point theorem
* Add drawing of fixed points iterations in the notebook -- basically verify how the fixed point iterations behave around/towards the fixed points by iteratively projecting the y values back to the x axis
* Implement a bundle adjustment example as a notebook and a self contained python file/class/package/function, whatever works best
* Compare the dogled against levenberg Marquardt for bundle adjustment 
* Implement linear solvers for sparse matrices 
* Implement SparseLMA
